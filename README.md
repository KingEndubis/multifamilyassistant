# Gemini Build Import

This repository is being reconstructed from the Gemini share link:

- Source: https://gemini.google.com/share/f55b4a952fe4

## Status

- The share page HTML (`gemini_share.html`) has been downloaded into the workspace.
- The page does not expose a direct downloadable build artifact via static links accessible from `Invoke-WebRequest`.

## Next Steps

If the build is a ZIP or other downloadable asset, please provide a direct URL to the file or upload the asset into this folder. Once present, we will:

1. Extract the build archive into the repository.
2. Verify and reconstruct source code (if the build contains compiled output only, we will recreate scaffolding based on app structure).
3. Commit the imported code and push to your GitHub repository.

## GitHub Push

Please share your GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`) or confirm a new repository name to create and push to. If you already have `gh` (GitHub CLI) authenticated, we can create and push in one step.
